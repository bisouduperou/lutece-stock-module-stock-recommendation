                    This module offers recommendations of purchase or reservation 
                    to users of the Stock plugin. It uses machine leaning technologies
                    provided by the <a href="http://mahout.apache.org/">Apache Mahout</a> library.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The recommendation principle is based on buying similarities with other users. 
                    The products offered are those that the user does not yet have while 
                    they have been retained by users having made orders close.
